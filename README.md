Welcome to Countify App! This simple yet powerful application helps you keep track of various counts and quantities in your daily life. Whether you want to count your daily steps, track your water intake, or tally the number of books you've read, Countify App has got you covered.

Features

Multiple Counters: Create and manage multiple counters to track different items or activities simultaneously. You can have separate counters for various purposes, such as exercise, nutrition, hobbies, or anything else you want to count.

Customizable Labels: Personalize your counters by assigning unique labels to them. This allows you to easily identify and distinguish between different counts.

Increment and Decrement: Increment or decrement the count values with a single tap. It's as simple as pressing a button to add or subtract from the count.

Reset: Reset individual counters to zero whenever needed. This feature is especially useful when you want to start counting from scratch or when a particular count has been completed.

History: View the history of each counter to keep track of changes over time. The app maintains a record of count updates, resets, and any other modifications made to the counters.
Dark Mode: Enjoy a visually comfortable experience with the option to switch to dark mode. It reduces eye strain and conserves battery life, especially in low-light environments.
